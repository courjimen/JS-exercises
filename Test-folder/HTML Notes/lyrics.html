            (Intro) Made a way Don't know how but You did it Made a way 
            Verse 1 Standing here not knowing How we'll get through this test But holding onto faith You know that Nothing can catch You by surprise You got this figured out and You're watching us now 
            Verse 2 But when it looks as if we can't win You wrap us in Your arm and step in 
            And everything we need You supply You got this in control And now we know that 
            Chorus 1 You made a way When our backs were against the wall And it looked as if it was over 
            You made a way And we're standing here Only because You made a way 
            Misc 2 (TAG) You made a way Verse 3 And now we're here Looking back on where we come from 
            Because of You and nothing we've done To deserve the love and mercy You've shown But Your grace was 
            strong enough to pick us up Misc 3 (Bridge) You move mountains You cause walls to fall 
            With Your power You perform miracles Made A Way
